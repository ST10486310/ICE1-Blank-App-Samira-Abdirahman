What was the most difficult part of the setup and how did you resolve it (or what did you try)?
I tried running the app without opening it in the integrated terminal which kept gaving me an error. I referred back to the notes in the module manual for guidance and then the app worked successfully.

Setup steps I followed
1- Created a file named 'MyInitialsAndGreeting'.
2- Opened Vs code ,file then opened a folder in Vs code.
3- Opened a new terminal and created the expo project by writing out the command to create the expo project.
4- Edited the text with a greeting 'Hello' and my intials 'Samira Abdirahman'
5- Edited the colour section with  baby blue .
6- I Ran the app on bluestacks with a command of 'npx expo start'.
